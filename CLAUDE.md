# FlowSpace

An all-in-one work management platform — projects, tasks, collaboration — built
as Go microservices in a monorepo. The purpose of this repository is to learn
how real enterprise systems work by building one, so the enterprise-grade
choice is the deliverable, not the shortest path to a working feature.

## Constraints that shape every answer

- One Ubuntu node runs both staging and production: 32 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD, one
  GPU. There is no managed cloud and no budget for one.
- One maintainer. Any process that needs a second person is theatre.
- Development is on macOS (arm64); the server is amd64.

Do not offer a simpler alternative to a pattern that was chosen deliberately —
the outbox, sagas, relationship-based authorization, dynamic secrets. The
complexity is the point. Do push back on anything whose cost lands on the
32 GB budget without earning it.

## Decisions live in docs/adr

Every ADR under `docs/adr/` is binding. Read the relevant one before changing
behaviour it governs.

- A change that contradicts an accepted ADR is a stop-and-say-so, never a
  judgement call.
- A change that needs a new decision carries its ADR in the same pull request.

### Writing an ADR

Copy `docs/adr/template.md`. Number sequentially and never reuse a number. The
filename slug carries no articles: `0009-one-go-module-for-repository.md`.

- Cite another ADR by number only if that file already exists. Name an
  undecided thing by its subject — "the migration tool" — never by a number
  reserved in advance.
- References point backwards. Never edit an older ADR to point forward at a
  newer one.
- Context, Decision and Consequences are immutable once Accepted. Status and
  cross-reference links are maintained in place.
- Section order follows the template exactly.
- Say what the decision costs. An ADR with nothing under "Negative" is
  unfinished, not clean.

## Repository layout

```text
api/openapi.yaml     public HTTP contract, source of truth
proto/               event and RPC contracts
gen/                 generated code, committed to the repository
services/<name>/
  cmd/               the only code outside internal/
  internal/          domain, app, adapter
pkg/                 infrastructure only, never domain types
deploy/              kustomize base and per-environment overlays
docs/adr/
```

One `go.mod` at the root. No `go.work`, no per-service modules, no `replace`.

### Boundaries

- A service's code lives under its own `internal/`. That is the boundary, and
  the compiler enforces it.
- Services never import one another. They communicate through the contracts in
  `proto/`.
- `pkg/` holds telemetry setup, interceptors, the outbox helper, error types. A
  domain type appearing in `pkg/` means a boundary is in the wrong place.

## Commits and pull requests

Branch commits are free-form and are discarded at merge. Write what state the
code is in, on one line:

```text
status transitions work, tests still red
revert to enum, lifecycle states got messy
```

Say whether the tests pass only when that is actually known from this session.
Do not run the suite to find out and do not guess — omit the clause instead. A
wrong claim about test state is worse than none, because it is what gets
trusted when scanning back for a point to return to.

Read `git status --short` before staging anything. `git add -A` without
looking is how the next sentence gets violated, and it is violated silently.
Never stage anything resembling a credential, a `.env` file, a build artifact,
a vendored directory, or a file over 1 MB. Name it and ask. A secret that
reaches a pushed branch is on the remote whether or not the squash carries it
to main.

Do not tidy branch history, and do not put reasoning in a commit body — that
belongs in the pull request description, which survives the squash.

The description is written once and then goes stale, because the branch keeps
growing after it. Reread it before merging and correct anything the later
commits made untrue. A body claiming a thing was left out, when the same
squash adds it, is a contradiction sealed into `git log` — main takes no
direct pushes, so there is no fixing it afterwards.

Wrap the description at 80 columns. GitHub copies it into the squash commit
verbatim rather than reflowing it, so a body written as one long line per
paragraph stays that way in `git log`, beside every commit that wraps.

The pull request title is a Conventional Commit and becomes the commit on main.
The scope is the service directory, or `repo` for repository-wide changes, and
`!` marks a breaking contract change:

```text
feat(workitem)!: replace status enum with lifecycle states
```

A title is a headline, not a sentence. Drop an article when removing it changes
only the length, and keep it when the phrase becomes ambiguous or means
something else without it — `revert to enum` and `revert to the enum` are not
the same claim. This governs pull request titles, branch commit subjects and
ADR filename slugs, which never carry one. It does not govern prose: an ADR
heading is read as language, so `0009-one-go-module-for-repository.md` is
titled "One Go module for the whole repository".

Titles are lower case throughout, with no trailing period. Two things keep the
casing they already have, because changing it makes them wrong rather than
merely inconsistent: proper nouns — `GitHub`, `gRPC`, `PostgreSQL` — and
identifiers taken from the code, such as `verifyEmail`.

## Markdown

`markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` must pass. Prose wraps at 80 columns. Tables are
exempt from the width limit and are padded so the pipes line up.
